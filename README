Running:
   cd to src/ and run gui.py

Notes:
   We are using Python 2.7, using an earlier (or quite frankly a newer)
version of Python will mean that at the very least the unit tests will
not pass. Please run all test scripts with python2.7. They altered the
test framework fairly dramatically with 2.7 and added a load of cool new
stuff which we use for them.

   That said it seems to work well enough with 2.4 upwards so have fun!

   Jakme has a config directory. To get the unit tests to pass we need
this to be in the expected place. Hopefully this'll be fixed in a
later release but for the mean time please symlink the jakme folder to
~/.jakme.
